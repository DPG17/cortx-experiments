EOS-16557 - Create load test tool for AuthServer capable of 4k RPS

Goal:
Determine if AuthServer can be tuned to sustain 4000 S3 API requests per second

Development:
Previously, we had used Locust to generate the load.But Locust, since it is using 
python libraries was not able to scale to a high RPS.
So, a C++ load generator was used.
- Requests were generated using the CURL library.
- For Digital Signing, part of the code were used from Amazon C++ SDK and from 
  https://github.com/rhymu8354/Excalibur/tree/main/AwsPlay
- Client/Server framework in https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-s3server/tree/main/scripts/libevhtp-throughput was used to send the requests.
